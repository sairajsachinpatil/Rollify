# Rollify
Rollify is a data-driven, AI/ML-inspired offline automation tool for colleges to fairly distribute students into roll calls, divisions, and batches ‚Äî balancing marks, branch, and gender ratio with a 94%+ fairness score, transforming weeks of manual work into seconds, while keeping all data 100% private.

üöÄ **Simplifying Student Roll Call Distribution for Colleges**

---

## Overview

During my time observing college administrative processes, I noticed a common challenge: **distributing students into roll calls and divisions fairly and efficiently** ‚Äî especially in first-year engineering, where students from multiple branches mix together. 

Traditional manual methods or Excel-based approaches often take **weeks** and fail to ensure balanced batches. This can lead to:

- Batches dominated by toppers or boys, which affects student motivation  
- Stigma around ‚Äútopper‚Äù vs ‚Äúweaker‚Äù batches  
- Unintentional bias by professors toward certain batches  
- Overall imbalance impacting learning opportunities and morale  

To solve this, I developed **Rollify**, a Flutter-based offline app that automates and simplifies this entire process ‚Äî from **weeks of work to just seconds** ‚Äî while keeping all data completely private.

## What is Rollify?

Rollify is designed specifically for college authorities to:

- **Equally distribute students** based on marks/percentile, branch, gender ratio, and alphabetical order  
- **Assign unique roll numbers, practical batches, and divisions** in seconds, even for large batches of 2000+ students  
- **Securely process input files** (CSV or Excel) locally, with **zero cloud upload or data sharing**, ensuring full data privacy  

Rollify currently supports:

- **Android APK** for mobile use  
- **Windows EXE desktop application** for faster processing in large colleges

## How Rollify Works (Backend Logic)

When you upload student data files, Rollify:

- Parses and validates the input carefully to catch errors or missing info  
- Applies statistical methods like **quartiles and binning**, inspired by IIT Madras Data Science courses  
- Uses a combination of distribution algorithms ‚Äî **Rule of Thumb, Round Robin, Snake, and Zigzag** ‚Äî to allocate students fairly across divisions  
- Handles edge cases like duplicate names and missing data to maintain accuracy  
- Prepares final data for quick preview, editing, and roll number generation  

This combination ensures students are evenly balanced across performance, gender, and branch ‚Äî avoiding clustering and boosting fairness.

## Impact and Benefits

- **Average allocation fairness around 94% +**, making student batches truly balanced  
- Drastically reduces the manual distribution time from weeks to seconds  
- Keeps all sensitive student data **offline and secure** with no cloud exposure  
- Helps improve student motivation and equal opportunity by preventing biased batch grouping

## Development Notes

- The core logic and algorithms are built on research and data science principles.  
- AI tools like **ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude** were used during development for coding assistance, debugging, and research, but the final design and integration are fully by me.  
- Rollify is open for further enhancements and is designed with modular code to allow future updates easily.
